# Drowsiness Detection
Detects if a person is "Drowsy" by using a Keras CNN Image Classifier that I trained. This project was made to learn how CNN's work, how to train your own CNN Classifier, and how to implement your CNN Classifier in real time using Computer Vision.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
These are the packages you will need to install for Python3 for the Detector to work (I used the Anaconda Installer).
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Numpy & Scipy
- Imutils

### Clone the Repository:
Use this command to clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/srinisriram/Drowsiness-Detection.git

### Run the Code:
Here is how you can run the Drowsiness Detector on your computer.
1. cd Drowsiness-Detection/detector
2. python3 Drowsiness_Detector.py

Here are some images of the detector running (I ran on a Raspberry Pi 4).
(Insert images)

Now you have ran the code!


## Understanding the Code:

If you want to understand the code, you can read each of the files that are provided in the "detector"
