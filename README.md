###DROWSINESS DETECTION
##Purpose
This project was made as an educational project. This teaches how CNN models work, how to train and build your own CNN model in Keras, and how to implement the CNN for classification in real time.

##Prerequisites
These are the packages you will need to install for Python:
1. Keras
2. OpenCV
3. Numpy and SciPy
4. Imutils
5. Dlib
I used Anaconda to install these libraries.

##Running the code
After installing the packages listed above, run the program Drowsiness_Detection.py 
Here are some images of the code running.

##How to build the CNN Classifier.
I used the Closed Eyes in the Wild dataset for training my CNN Model.

Here is the link for the code that I used to train my CNN.
